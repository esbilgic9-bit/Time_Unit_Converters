# Time Unit Converters ⏱️

This repository contains two Python scripts designed to convert a large number of seconds into human-readable time units. These projects demonstrate my progress in learning arithmetic operators and logical sequencing in Python.

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1. Simple Time Converter (`time_converter.py`)
A basic script that takes a total number of seconds and breaks it down into:
* Hours
* Minutes
* Seconds

### 2. Full Time Converter (`full_time_converter.py`)
An advanced version that handles much larger durations by calculating:
* Weeks
* Days
* Hours
* Minutes
* Seconds

## 🛠️ Features
- Uses **Integer Division (`//`)** and **Modulo (`%`)** operators for precise calculations.
- Clean and well-commented code for easy understanding.
- Dynamic user input using the `input()` function.

## 💻 How to Run
Simply run the scripts using Python:
```bash
python full_time_converter.py

### 🚀 The Optimization Challenge (Refactored Version)
I have updated the logic to be more professional and efficient. Instead of repetitive calculations, I used a sequential approach with variables to make the code cleaner and easier to read.

**Key Improvements:**
* **Reduced Redundancy:** Calculated units step-by-step using a "remaining seconds" variable.
* **Better Readability:** The code is now much shorter and follows professional Python standards.
* **Logic Clarity:** Uses integer division (`//`) and modulo (`%`) more effectively to track data flow.
